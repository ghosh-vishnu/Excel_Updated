1. Check if logic detection is working:
   - First line after Executive Summary: Market Overview
   - Is it bold? Should be False
   - Is it in list? Should be True
   - Second line: Market Attractiveness
   - Is it bold? Should be False
   - Is it in list? Should be True

2. Expected detection:
   - first_line_bold = False
   - first_line_in_list = True
   - second_line_bold = False
   - second_line_in_list = True
   - has_nested_lists = False
